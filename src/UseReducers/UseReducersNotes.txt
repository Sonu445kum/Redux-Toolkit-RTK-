const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

state → current state value.

dispatch → function you call to trigger changes.

reducer → function (state, action) => newState.

initialState → starting state.


Key Points:

Action is just an object { type, payload }.

Reducer always returns a new state.

dispatch sends the action → reducer → updates state.
